# Personal Docs

This repository is just a bunch of markdown files with developer stuff - kinda a notebook with pretty formatting. Use it as reference material if you wish, but it's not complete - not even close.

The only reason this is publically available is because:

* I don't have a premium Github account.
* I can't be bothered logging into Github on every device I own (yeah I'm that lazy).

If you want, you can contribute, but there are probably more productive things you should be doing right now, so get back to work!
